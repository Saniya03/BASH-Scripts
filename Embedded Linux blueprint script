 # embedded device terminology


# HMI (Human-Machine Interface)
: The interface through which operators interact with and control industrial systems. It includes graphical displays, touchscreens, and input devices.

# PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
A ruggedized computer used for industrial automation and control. PLCs are often programmed to control machinery and processes.

# RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)
n operating system that is designed to meet real-time requirements, ensuring that tasks are executed within specified time constraints. Used in applications where precise timing is critical.

# SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
 A system for monitoring and controlling industrial processes. SCADA systems typically collect data from sensors and devices in real-time.

# OTA (Over-the-Air) Updates
The capability to update software and firmware on embedded devices remotely, without requiring physical access to the device.
